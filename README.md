### Hi there, I'm Amr AlaaðŸ‘‹ 

## I'm a Computer Vision and Machine Learning Engineer!!



### Project Description:

## Advanced Lane Finding
this project is a part of [![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

In this project, my goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video, and here is [the output video!](http://www.udacity.com/drive)



The steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.
